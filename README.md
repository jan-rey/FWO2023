RW_MLeps_compare_contexts.py
> Script which meta-learns the epsilon parameter in an epsilon-greedy decision-making process in different contexts (stable, volatile, variable). Script containts 4 functions: 1) without meta-learning to compare, 2) meta-learning epsilon in a reinforced variable environment, 3) meta-learning epsilon in a stable environment, 4) meta-learning epsilon in a volatile environment. Then, each condition is simulated and the results are plotted.

RW_MLtemp_compare_contexts_2.py
> Script which meta-learns the temperature parameter in an Softmax decision-making process in different contexts (stable, volatile, variable). Script containts 4 functions: 1) without meta-learning to compare, 2) meta-learning temperature in a reinforced variable environment, 3) meta-learning temperature in a stable environment, 4) meta-learning temperature in a volatile environment. Then, each condition is simulated and the results are plotted.
